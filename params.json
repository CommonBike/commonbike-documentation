{"name":"MyWheels open mobility platform","tagline":"Car Sharing , Bike Sharing, Boat sharing","body":"# We love to share\r\nMyWheels is a not-for profit organization for shared mobility. Car Sharing and Bike Sharing are our favourites, but we also like boat sharing.\r\n\r\nBeside sharing bikes and cars, we love to share software. There are so many sharing platforms developing their own websites and App's. Together we can save a lot of effort and make a better and more sustainable platform. Feel free to contact us. We love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nRonald Haverman\r\nCTO MyWheels.nl\r\n\r\n\r\n# Central repository\r\nWe use Github as our central repository for our source code. Anyone can view our open source repositories, and with a free Github account, raise issues and contribute to our source code.\r\n\r\n# Feature requests and bug fixes\r\nWe use Github Issues to track issues for each of our open source repositories.\r\n\r\nEach of the open repositories has a link for issues and; feel free to submit feature requests and raise bugs on Github, or star a repository to follow its progress.\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nWe welcome contributions to all of our open source repositories. These contributions come in the form of a Pull Request, where you \"fork\" our repositories and then request that we \"pull\" your changes back into our repositories. You must have a Github account to make a contribution.\r\n\r\nAll contributors must first sign the MyWheels Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which is based on the Google CLA, and provides the MyWheels team a license to re-distribute your contributions.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:\r\n\r\n* Keep each pull request small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.\r\n* Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code. \r\n* Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions. \r\n\r\n\r\n# OpenWheels platform & API access \r\nOur shared mobility platform can be used as Software as a Service (SaaS) with the [openwheels-frontend](http://github.com/mywheels/openwheels-frontend), or through the JSOM-RPC API directly. Contact us to get access and receive the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Closed user group for platform source code\r\nThe platform source code (core and API) is not open source (yet) due to work to do, security and financial reasons. Because we love to share, the source code is available for a closed user group under (almost) the same conditions as open source. Please contact us for information and conditions how to apply. This might be an awesome way to develop your own version of the shared mobility platform.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
