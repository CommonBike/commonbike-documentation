{"name":"Common Bike open bike sharing platform","tagline":"Bike Sharing ,  Boat sharing, Car Sharing ","body":"# We love to share\r\nBike Sharing is our favourites, but we also like boat sharing and car sharing. \r\n\r\nBeside sharing bikes, we love to share software. There are so many sharing platforms developing their own websites and App's. We raised the question: How would the world be if we share this knowledge and software? How would it be if we work together to enable bike sharing everywhere on this planet.\r\nFeel free to contact us. We love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nRonald Haverman\r\nFounder CommonBike\r\n\r\n##Feature requests and bug fixes\r\nWe will use Github Issues to track issues and features.\r\nFeel free to submit feature requests and raise bugs.
