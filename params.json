{"name":"MyWheels open mobility platform","tagline":"Car Sharing , Bike Sharing, Boat sharing","body":"# We love to share\r\nMyWheels is a not-for profit organization for shared mobility. Car Sharing and Bike Sharing are our favourites, but we also like boat sharing.\r\n\r\nBeside sharing mobility, we love to share software. There are so many sharing platforms developing their own websites and App's. Together we can save a lot of effort and make a better and more sustainable platform. Feel free to contact us. We love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nRonald Haverman\r\nCTO MyWheels.nl\r\n\r\n#Vision\r\nMyWheels provides an open standard and platform for car sharing and bike sharing. We started this initiative because sharing is getting popular and a lot of parties are busy developing software for sharing mobility. Software that has a lot of similarities with other sharing software. Apps with a lot off similarities. \r\n\r\nWe raised the question: How would the world be if we share this knowledge and software? How would it be if we work together to enable car sharing and bike sharing everywhere on this planet.\r\n\r\n# Central repository\r\nWe use Github as our central repository for our source code. Anyone can view our open source repositories, and with a free Github account, raise issues and contribute to our source code.\r\n\r\n# Help us with feature requests and bug fixes\r\nWe use Github Issues to track issues and features.\r\nFeel free to submit feature requests and raise bugs. We are happy with your help and feed-back.\r\nPlease use [our Github issue tracker](https://github.com/MyWheels/openwheels-frontend/issues) for alle issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nWe welcome contributions to all of our open source repositories. These contributions come in the form of a Pull Request, where you \"fork\" our repositories and then request that we \"pull\" your changes back into our repositories. You must have a Github account to make a contribution.\r\n\r\nAll contributors must first sign the MyWheels Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which is based on the Google CLA, and provides the MyWheels team a license to re-distribute your contributions.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:\r\n\r\n* Keep each pull request small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.\r\n* Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code. \r\n* Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# OpenWheels platform & API access \r\nOur shared mobility platform can be used as Software as a Service (SaaS) with the [openwheels-frontend](http://github.com/mywheels/openwheels-frontend), or through the JSON-RPC API directly. Contact us to get access and receive the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Closed user group for platform source code\r\nThe platform source code (core and API) is not open source (yet) due to work to do, security and financial reasons. Because we love to share, the source code is available for a closed user group under (almost) the same conditions as open source. Please contact us for information and conditions how to apply. This might be an awesome way to develop your own version of the shared mobility platform.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear you: support 'at' mywheels.nl or [MyWheels.nl](https://mywheels.nl) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
