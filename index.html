<p>MyWheels is a not-for profit organization for shared mobility. Car Sharing and Bike Sharing are our favourites, but we also like boat sharing. </p>

<p>Beside sharing mobility, we love to share software. There are so many sharing platforms developing their own websites and App's. We raised the question: How would the world be if we share this knowledge and software? How would it be if we work together to enable car sharing and bike sharing everywhere on this planet.
Feel free to contact us. We love to hear from you.</p>

<p>We use Github Issues to track issues and features.
Feel free to submit feature requests and raise bugs. We are happy with your help and feed-back.
Please use <a href="https://github.com/MyWheels/openwheels-frontend/issues">our Github issue tracker</a> for alle issues.
Anyone can view our open source repositories, and with a free Github account, raise issues and contribute to our source code.</p>

<h2>
<a id="contributions" class="anchor" href="#contributions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributions</h2>

<p>We welcome contributions to all of our open source repositories. These contributions come in the form of a Pull Request, where you "fork" our repositories and then request that we "pull" your changes back into our repositories. You must have a Github account to make a contribution.</p>

<p>All contributors must first sign the MyWheels Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which is based on the Google CLA, and provides the MyWheels team a license to re-distribute your contributions. Whenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep each pull request small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code. </li>
<li>Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions. </li>
</ul>

<p>Our shared mobility platform can be used as Software as a Service (SaaS) with the <a href="http://github.com/mywheels/openwheels-frontend">openwheels-frontend</a>, or through the JSON-RPC API directly. Contact us to get access and receive the documentation.</p>

<a id="closed-user-group-for-platform-source-code" class="anchor" href="#closed-user-group-for-platform-source-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Closed user group for platform source code</h2>

<p>The platform source code (core and API) is not open source (yet) due to work to do, security and financial reasons. Because we love to share, the source code is available for a closed user group under (almost) the same conditions as open source. Please contact us for information and conditions how to apply. This might be an awesome way to develop your own version of the shared mobility platform.</p>

<p>We love to hear you: support 'at' mywheels.nl or <a href="https://mywheels.nl">MyWheels.nl</a> </p>
